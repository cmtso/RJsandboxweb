Dear Professor Cook,
\bigskip

Please consider our article titled "Advancing Reproducible Research by Publishing R Markdown Notebooks as Interactive Sandboxes Using the learnr Package
" for publication in the R Journal.

The manuscript introduces a new application of the 'learnr' package to help authors to make elements of their research analysis more readily reproducible to users.

We believe the readers of the R Journal will find this article helpful for their work because it provides generally useful instructions that will work for many purposes.

Dear Professor Cook,
\bigskip

Please consider our article titled "Advancing Reproducible Research by Publishing R Markdown Notebooks as Interactive Sandboxes Using the learnr Package" for publication in the R Journal.

The manuscript introduces a new application of the 'learnr' package to help authors to make elements of their research analysis more readily reproducible to users.

We would like to thank the reviewer for the thorough review and helpful edits. We have proofread the entire article again and have accepted all the suggestions with the exception of:

- We are keeping the header 'Approach:...' because it is the approach to tackle the challenge outlined at the beginning of the article, which is a novel application of the learnr package.

- We are keeping our Shiny UI example as a selector rather than a checkboxGroupInput, as we think it looks better.

- Regarding the comment on the difference between R Markdown document and R notebook, we have changed most of the occurrences to 'R Markdown document'. Any mention of notebook in the paper is referred to notebook technologies in general (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notebook_interface). Here we essentially refer 'R Markdown documents' as an example of notebooks. Except in the title, we have replaced all 'R notebook' or 'R Markdown notebook' to 'R Markdown documents'. Any mention of 'notebook' refers to notebook interfaces in general.
